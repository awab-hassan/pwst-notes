---- Web Application Concepts ----

2-1: Servers and Clients

Server is basically a machine or a software that provides information to clients, we make HTTP/HTTPS request using web browsers but also wget, curl etc. So we as a client sends a requests to server and then server serves the information/data.

2-2: Lab - Nginx and Server Logs

Basically analysing the logs, like we can make requests using curl, nc or a web browser and on the server side logs the server receives requests from us (clients).

2-3: HTTP

The protocol that defines how web traffic is structrued. We as user make http requests to URL with a method, for example generally we are working with get method because its basically when you request [somewebsite.com](http://somewebsite.com) you are basically using a GET method.

If you are posting some infomration or inputing some data then you are using POST method. DELETE method when you want to delete something, HEAD and OPTIONS are more of a metadata headers.

All the requests have headers, also metadata about request, used for authentication, client identification etc. Some requests have a body like form submission or sending data via API.  

Every response has a Response code, 200’s are success, 300’s are redirects, 400’s are Failed access. 500’s are erros. Responses can have a body HTML, JSON or even binary data. Ps Modifying User-agent can be a legitmate attack vector.
